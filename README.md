# Fabric-Assessment
I have created a workspace named ws_fabrikam where I ingested JSON and text data and used dataflows to transform these unstructured formats into structured tables. I organized the data using the medallion architecture, applying silver layer transformations to clean, refine, and enrich the data.

In the gold layer, I developed dimensional and fact tables to support analytical queries and reporting within the data warehouse, enabling efficient and reliable data analysis.
